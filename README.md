# audio_site_sinatra
The idea behind this website is:

1. To Showcase and solidify my knowledge in Database management through user signups and logins.
2. To Present simple HTML/CSS that is clean and functional, which interacts with the controller for unique-to-user webpages.
3. To take a small step towards an online interactive Digital Audio Workstation for real time remote collaboration, which is a long term goal of mine.
4. Finally, To push beyond what is being taught here, and include API's and elements beyond my current ability, in order to push myself further.
